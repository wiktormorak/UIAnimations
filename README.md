# UIAnimations

A collection of Unity UI animations that are highly customisable.


[Fade Animation] (https://github.com/wiktormorak/UIAnimations/blob/main/Assets/TextFadeAnimation.cs) - This animation has the option to move text, fade the text colour alpha and also merge 2 colours together. You can also do each of them on their own without necessarily running moving the text etc.
